# Reddit Clone API

This is the backend for my [Reddit Clone Project](https://kgilla.github.io/reddit-clone/) built using the MERN stack. This API was really a leap forward in terms of my ability to write more concise functions with a large shift towards using Javascript's async await and promises. I have attempted to mimic much of the functionality of Reddit, from vote casting to comment nesting.

## Learning Objectives

- Create a performant API
- Better utilize RESTful HTTP protocols
- Delve further into Mongoose and MongoDBs methods to expolore pre middleware, built in increment and array manipulating functions to lessen code bloat and to make code more performant.
- Write out all functions using async await and Promise.all() where and whenever possible.
- Further my knowledge, understanding, and confidence surrounding backend development.

## Things To Add

- Flesh out user controller, allowing updating of password and email as well as deletion.
- Incorporate AWS to allow uploading of images
- Add pagination and more robust sorting functions
